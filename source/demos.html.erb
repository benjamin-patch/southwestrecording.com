testimonial: Anything I've ever done that's won awards, national Telly's on down, has had Allan's hands on the audio. I know I can turn a project over to him and it'll come back even better than I'd planned. He's fast and thorough, and he knows his stuff! A session with him is like a walk in the park, except without all the bees and muggers.
