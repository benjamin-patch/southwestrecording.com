    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "...an artist, a musician, a technical wizard only begin to describe the
        traits of this accomplished sound engineer. Allan's devotion to my
        projects, his drive for perfection, and his consistent ability to
        deliver one masterpiece after another, make it inconceivable to
        consider anyone else for my National Park Audio Guides. Quite simply,
        trying to find anyone with more talent, patience, or sense of humor
        would be futile!"
